# feature:record — Your record

The record from Stash on the web, built into the app (design: `~/.stash/design/record-in-app-2026-10-26/PLAN.md`). The fork of
On Record (`rawnaldclark/stash-on-record`, branch `stash/app-host`) is bundled here and runs offline in a full-screen WebView;
the app feeds it this phone's plays, and a play tapped in it plays in Stash.

## The bundled record

| Served at | From | What |
|---|---|---|
| `https://appassets.androidplatform.net/record/embed.html?embed=stash-app` | `src/main/assets/record/` | the fork's `dist/embed.html` and `dist/assets/` |
| `https://appassets.androidplatform.net/fonts/` | `src/main/assets/record-fonts/` | Inter and Space Grotesk (theme.css loads them from the site root), with their OFL licences |

**Bundled build:** stash-on-record `9dff865` ("test(stash): a parity fixture for the app's Home card, made by the record's own
code"), 1,517,255 bytes, plus 65,663 bytes of fonts. The page at this commit takes the app's rows up to 24 h, keeps the first
row per id, sorts them by id, and sends `stash:save`.

The Home card's parity fixture (`src/test/resources/parity/`, `card-parity.rows.json` and `card-parity.expect.json`) is the
fork's `src/stash/fixtures/` at the same commit, byte for byte: refresh it with the build when the page's logic changes.

Left out on purpose: the landing page and the site's files (`index.html`, `index-*`, `og.png`, icons, `robots.txt`,
`sitemap.xml`, `_headers`), the demo's chunk (`load-*.js`, imported only with `?demo=1`), every `.woff` (the `.woff2` is used
everywhere) and Instrument Serif's upright 400 (the embed sets it italic only).

### Refreshing it

1. In the fork, on `stash/app-host`: `npm run build`.
2. From this repository's root: `node feature/record/scripts/record-assets.mjs --fork <stash-on-record> --fonts <stash-player>/static/fonts`
   (the defaults are the sibling checkouts next to the main one, `../stash-on-record` and `../stash-web/player-upi/static/fonts`).
   It empties both asset folders first and fails without copying when the build's `embed.html` names a file that isn't there.
3. Update the commit above, build, and check the record on a phone.

## The bridge (protocol v1)

`StashHost` is injected into the page before its scripts run (`WebViewCompat.addWebMessageListener`, this origin only). The page
posts JSON strings to it; the reply proxy from its `stash:hello` carries the app's answers. `bridge/RecordHost.kt` handles each
message and is tested apart from the WebView; `RecordMessages.kt` reads and writes them with the web player's rules.

## Covers

`art/` is the web's cover lookup run on the phone: `ArtLookup` is the Worker's (`worker/art.ts`: Deezer album, then Deezer
track, then Apple's iTunes search, sized 600; artist pictures from Deezer, its searches paced), `RecordArt` the client's
(`src/lib/spotify/art.ts`: batches of 25, a minute's pause after a refusal, one retry of what Deezer couldn't look up yet). Kept
in `noBackupFilesDir/record-art.tsv` (180 days a cover, 3 days a miss). Only Deezer CDN and mzstatic addresses are taken: the
record's page allows no other images.
